A memory test confirms that all storage areas on a memory device are active. In other words, if the number 50 is stored at a given address, you may expect to see it there until another number is recorded. Any memory test works on the basic idea of writing data to each address in the memory device and then reading the data back to check that it is correct. If all of the values read back match the ones written, the memory device is considered to have passed the test. As you will see, the only way to be sure that a passing result suggests something is to carefully choose the set of data values.
